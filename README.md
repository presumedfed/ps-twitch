## Rules:
- Write a simple web app that hits the Twitch API URL shown at the top (there are API docs online)
- Use JSONP when utilizing the Twitch API's
- Build the URL based on the query entered by the user in the search box shown in the mock
- Build out the list as shown in the mock. 
- All UI elements are mandatory and self-explanatory
- Feel free to add more/better UI, as long as you include the mandatory elements
- No frameworks like jQuery/AngularJS, please use vanilla JS to implement UX, hit the API and render content
 
Submit your code to a github repo and send us the link.  You can host the running app on github.io.

## Getting Started
- install packages - `npm install`
- build project - `gulp build` (for development `gulp watch`)
- start node server - `npm start` 
- browse to http://localhost:3000
 

## TODO 

- Add spinner while waiting for api to return
- debounce the clicks on next/prev
- occasional scaling issue with screenshot on smaller viewports
